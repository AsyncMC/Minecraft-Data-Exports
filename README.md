Minecraft Data Exports
======================

This repository contains Minecraft data which were exported using the
[Minecraft Data Generators](https://wiki.vg/Data_Generators) on Minecraft Java Edition and
other means, like [PowerNukkit ProxyPass](https://github.com/PowerNukkit/Bedrock-ProxyPass),
[Cloudburst ProxyPass](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/ProxyPass), [PocketMineMP methods](https://github.com/pmmp/BedrockData),
etc for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

The folder structure avoid spaces to make easier for script creations and it always has a "Current" folder for the
version being added on the commit (or the version in tag), allowing easier comparision by comparing the folder with different git tags
here on GitHub.

Minecraft Java Edition versions prior to 1.13 will be added later using other means, like extracting data using a custom forge mod for
that version since the Data Generators command is not available on such versions.

## LICENSE
I really don't know how to correctly license this data since they are mostly exported from Minecraft itself using it's own code.

I would not fight for it and I don't really mind how this repository is used.

I would deliberaly throw this on public domain [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/), but if it is
not allowed for some reason, consider this on [Apache V2 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or any permissive
license that is allowed by the laws in your country (if licensing is really necessary for you, check this with your lawyer)
